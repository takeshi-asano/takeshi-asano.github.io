    <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </li>
      <p>My long term goal is to become a software engineer and develop my own application in the future.</p>
      <li>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
      </li>
      <p>My strength when it comes to learning is I apply it into action instead of theory. I like learning from failures as my limitation. </p>
      <li> 
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </li>
      <p>I want to develop my leadership skills.</p>
      <li> 
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other 
          learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      </li>
      <p>On a non-working day I commit to dedicate 4-5 hours a day to study and do my sprint. On a working day, I commit
        to study at least 1-2 hours. If I knew that I would be running out of time to study straight, I would still make a way to study during my
        break period, while eating and make sure to inform my home group in case I won't be able to attend to a meeting.</p>
      <li> 
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
      </li>
      <p>On this situation, I take a break, I refresh my mind and reflect things from the beginning to help me to decide on my next step.
        If I am still stuck, I seek for help and opinion.</p>
      <li> 
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
      </li>
      <p>I expect my Facilitation team to guide and teach me how to overcome the challenges of this course.</p>
      <li> 
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, 
you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </li>
      <p>My daily routine usually look like this:
        6am: Exercise, 7am: Work, 10am: breakfast, 1pm: lunch 4pm: Exercise, 6pm: dinner, 7pm: study, 11pm: bed time
        I normally study whenever I can. </p>
    </ol>
