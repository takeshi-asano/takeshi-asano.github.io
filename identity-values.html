    <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
      <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you 
        weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </li>
      <p>Last week my laptop developed a big black mark in the middle of the screen. It was a nightmare for me as I'm used to going
        out and bringing my laptop with me. From there on I decided not to go out for a week and work inside my room using
        an external monitor. One of my values that I hold is being positive, resourceful. I am happy and proud of myself
        that I prioritize my responsibilities.</p>
      <li>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
      </li>
      <p>I was raised in a mix of Japanese & Filipino culture  and it has both a blend of traditions, respect, attention to detail, and a deep appreciation for nature that influenced me a lot.  </p>
      <li> 
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
      </li>
      <p>I am resilient and so much of perseverance. I believe they can support you in your learning journey by providing encouragement, creating a positive and nurturing environment, and offering resources and guidance when needed.</p>
      <li> 
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </li>
      <p>I have the bad habit of overthinking things and getting out of focus in my next step. This will slow down my progress. I want to remind myself to focus on objectives.</p>
      <li> 
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, 
        and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      </li>
      <p>At the time when we were sharing thoughts it was not that effective. What I would try now is to understand others' thoughts and opinions to build that connection with them. </p>
    </ol>
