              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
            </li>
            <p>I have learned that I am capable of solving problems by breaking the problems into small.</p>
              <p>I have learned that I am capable of pushing myself beyond the limits that I imposed upon myself.</p>
              <p>I have learned not to be hard on myself when I can't solve a problem.</p>
            <li>
              What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
            </li>
            <p>Values help us make good decision making.
              Empathy helps us understand and care about the people who will read our codes.
              Self-awareness helps us recognize our strengths and weaknesses, 
              so we can improve and adapt to new challenges in our learning and programming journey.</p>
           <li>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
           </li>
           <p>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset.</p>
           <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
           <p>The hardest part is to stick to my learning routine.</p>
           <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.     </li>
           <p>Like what DevAcademy says, Tech employers are looking for exceptional human beings. Surely, not a waste of time. Core learning is so important to become a successful programmer because involves lots of problem-solving.</p>
