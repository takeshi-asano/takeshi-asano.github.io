            <p>In a nutshell, EI is the ability to understand behaviours of others and controlling own emotions.
              It teaches you to take responsibility for your feelings. Also that offense is taken and not given. 
              It also helps you to become more conscious instead of reacting impusively.</p>

            <p>EQ is about your emotional awareness, empathy, and social skills. IQ looks at your brainpower, while EQ looks at your emotional smarts and how you handle relationships and emotions. IQ is more about your cognitive abilities and how smart you are in terms of traditional intelligence.</p>

            <p>EQ is important because it helps us understand and handle emotions better, build strong relationships, resolve conflicts, be effective leaders and team players, and promote our own well-being and the well-being of others. 
              It is a valuable skill that enhances our personal and social lives.</p>
