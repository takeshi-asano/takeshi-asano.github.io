            <li>Neuroplasticity</li>
            
            <p>Understanding neuroplasticity empowers us to improve learning, recover from brain injuries, manage mental health, and adapt to challenges by rewiring our brains through new habits and a positive mindset.</p>
            <p>Actively seeking new learning experiences, challenging our brains, and practicing positive habits shape our brains positively, making them more flexible and adaptable in our lives.</p>
            <p>A good resource to enhance your neuroplasticity:  <a id="git" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOJL3gjc8ak">Youtube TED Talk Link</a></p>
              
           

            

            <li>Growth Mindset</li>
             
            <p>A growth mindset means believing that you can get smarter and better at things if you work hard and keep trying. It's important because it helps you bounce back from challenges, enjoy learning, and achieve more in life.</p>
            <p>I am a bit surprise that I can actually get through challenges and problems that I would not ever thought I could. This change learning change me a lot on how to deal problems.</p>
            <p>I would embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and focus on the process of learning rather than just the outcomes.</p>

            <li>Blending to my learning plan</li>
            <p>By understanding that our brains can change and adopting a mindset that believes we can improve, it would influence how I approach my learning journey. I would be more resilient, persistent, and adaptable, seeing challenges as chances to grow and mistakes as opportunities for improvement. I would actively seek continuous growth and strive to better myself.</p>
