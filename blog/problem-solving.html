      <li>1. were blocked on a simple problem:
      </li>
      <p>My long term goal is to become a software engineer and develop my own application in the future.</p>
      <li>
        2. elegantly solved a problem.
      </li>
      <p>My strength when it comes to learning is I apply it into action instead of theory. I like learning from failures as my limitation. </p>
      <li> 
        3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
      </li>
      <p>I want to develop my leadership skills.</p>
      <li> 
        4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.
      </li>
      <p>On a non-working day I commit to dedicate 4-5 hours a day to study and do my sprint. On a working day, I commit
        to study at least 1-2 hours. If I knew that I would be running out of time to study straight, I would still make a way to study during my
        break period, while eating and make sure to inform my home group in case I won't be able to attend to a meeting.</p>

        <p>My daily routine usually look like this:
          6am: Exercise, 7am: Work, 10am: breakfast, 1pm: lunch 4pm: Exercise, 6pm: dinner, 7pm: study, 11pm: bed time
          I normally study whenever I can. </p>
