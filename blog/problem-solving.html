    <h1 class="grey-text">Problem-solving</h1>
    <div>
    <p>
      <h5 class="grey-text">Were blocked on a simple problem:</h5>
      <ol>
      <li>what was the problem?
      </li>
      <p>There a typo on the other variable.</p>
      <li>
        what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      </li>
      <p>Trying something, reading error. </p>
      <li> 
        how did you feel throughout the process?
      </li>
      <p>I felt a bit disappointed as I could not really see what was wrong with my answer.</p>
      <li> 
        what did you learn?
      </li>
      <p>I learned that to be patient and dont jump to bigger solution quickly.</p>
     
      </ol>

      <h5 class="grey-text">Elegantly solved a problem.</h5>
      <ol>
      <li>what was the problem?
      </li>
      <p>I could not figure out what kind of Javascript method to use to solve the kata task.</p>
      <li>
        what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      </li>
      <p>I used Pseudocoding, Rubber Ducky, googling. </p>
      <li> 
        how did you feel throughout the process?
      </li>
      <p>I was overwhelmed with the information showing and felt a bit drained.</p>
      <li> 
        what did you learn?
      </li>
      <p>I learned that taking a good break and puting away the problem refreshes my mind.</p>
     
      </ol>

      <h5 class="grey-text">3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h5>
      <p>I feel more confident on using more of Pseudocoding, rubber ducky, and googling first as it helps me outline the logic steps and understand the problem.
        I used Console.logging and reading errors when I want to test my initial answers. This provides me valuable insights into what went wrong and gives a hint to solve the problem.
      </p>

      <h5 class="grey-text">4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h5>
      <p>When I was doing one of the Kata challenge. The main reason for my reluctance was a bit of fear of appearing incompetent. As I continued to struggle, I realized the my reluctance to ask for help was hindering my progress.
        I eventually decided to put ego aside and reach out to my friend and it is okay to ask help.
